            As the world around us continues to evolve, humans naturally become curious about events they are not quite sure about. With the advancements of technology at such a
             rapid rate it is possible to make even the most far-fetched events appear to be real. People begin to wonder what is real and what is fabricated. It is through this
              curiosity that conspiracy theories are formed. In recent years, the internet has become a large part of this process as people are able to share and discuss events 
              that they aren't quite sure of. This is why we must always stay vigilant and make sure to gather all the facts before coming to a firm conclusion.

        <p id="what_is_a_conspiracy_theory_text">
            Conspiracy theories are far-fetched hypotheses to give alternate explanations about an event that has occurred. Usually a conspiracy theory is a justification that the 
            event was preplanned or a reasoning as to why something almost impossible happened. These theories are seen all over the globe and make people question the reality they 
            are living in.

                The September 11th attacks were the biggest terrorist attacks and one of the most deadly strikes ever. With almost 3000 people killed and over $10 billion worth of

                classified military base where aliens are supposedly being kept. Is it possible that all the internet memes are right and there really are aliens being kept there?
