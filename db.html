                    On November 24th, 1971, a man now known as DB Cooper bought a one way ticket to Seattle, Washington. According to witnesses he wore a business suit, looked to be in his mid 40s and ordered a drink. Later on the flight he handed a flight attendant a note explaining that he had an explosive device in his bag. The flight attendant then received another note listing demands, she delivered this to the captain of the plane. The demands were four parachutes and $200,000 (nearly $1.4M today).
                    <br><br>
                    When the flight landed at its intended destination he traded the passengers for the money and parachutes (he kept some passengers on the plane as an insurance policy), he also demanded the pilots take him to Mexico City. Sometime during this flight Cooper jumped out of the back of the plane with the money.

                    His fate still remains unknown with many people wondering...

                    Who was DB Cooper and what happened to him?

                        After 800 suspects and five years of hard work by the FBI they nailed it down to twelve possible people. One among them stood out: Richard Floyd McCoy was caught trying to perform a similar hijacking five months later. With this information, he was a favorite among detectives but when asked to verify the physical identity of the man, the witnesses determined that he was not the same person. However, this still is not solid confirmation that he wasn't DB Cooper. It is also discussed the possibility of Cooper blackmailing the witnesses on the plane someway in order to drive the FBI away from the truth. If this is the case then Cooper probably landed somewhere in Nevada as that is where the pilots said they were over when the suspect jumped out.

                        The more popular theory about the DB Cooper is that he simply didn't survive the fall. According to reports done by the FBI, Cooper took a parachute that he could not steer and was not at all an experienced skydiver. Nine years after this event a kid found a package full of twenty dollar bills worth nearly $6,000. This package was found in a wooded area suggesting that Cooper would have landed somewhere around that area. The money is confirmed to be the ransom money as it shared the same serial numbers. This still does not confirm his death or his identity. If he really did die during the fall then his corpse may not be far from the salvaged money.

                    Both of these theories are very possible and both have their respective supporters. The first theory listed has also been tweaked in some ways by keeping the story and only changing the suspect. This is seen heavily throughout mainstream media such as Prison Break (2005) and more recently Loki (2021) where they both provide a different point of view on the incident and solved the mystery on who the real culprit was. This proves that this mystery is one of the greatest of all time as even though it happened fifty years ago it can still be just as intriguing today.
                    <br><br>
                    Looking at just the facts without the influence of movies or TV shows, it is more than likely that the second theory is correct as it has more evidence to support it. The one thing that leaves this claim up for debate is the absence of a corpse. I suppose it is possible that his body could have ended up in a river where no one could ever find it.
