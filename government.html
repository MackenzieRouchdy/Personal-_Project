                    Conspiracy theories are made by conspiracy theorists and regular people who are not quite sure about something they have witnessed. They are typically about an event that will shape the future and thrive with leaks and modification of facts. They are often twisted truths and contributed by people who don't believe information the government is giving them. The theorists claim that the government is hiding the truth and give explanations for these strange events to define their opinion.

                    The government around us dictates our lives. We may think we have freedom and are allowed to do what we want. Perhaps this is just what the government wants you to think. They could do this by implementing fake ideas or beliefs into the world in an attempt to predict thoughts and keep everyone in check. This theory states that it is actually the government that is releasing all of these unbelievable theories that are so crazy that they provide the perfect cover for the ones that are real. For example, if the government released several fake ridiculous conspiracy theories then when a true theory comes along no one cares about it because it is not nearly as crazy as all the other theories.
                    <br><br>
                    The government could also create conspiracy theories that would scare their enemy and help them with a conflict that is happening. For example, the Area 51 theory was "leaked" by the government to make the Soviets believe that the US had their hands on alien technology during the Cold War. This way the Soviets would be scared to launch an offensive and would instead surrender out of fear.
                    <br><br>
                    Another way for the government to exploit this advantage they have would be to misdirect the public and put them even farther from the truth. For example, Marilyn Monroe's death was allegedly caused by an overdose, but many believe it was because of her affairs with the Kennedy brothers. Perhaps this theory came from the government who wishes to hide the potential truth that she died later from a completely different cause or even that she is still alive.

                    This theory is hard to shed light on since the only way to really find out the truth is to find the source of every theory. If the government was involved then it would be nearly impossible to track and prove the sources of these conspiracy theories. This is because they are often formed off of bits and parts of inaccurate information. This causes it to be very difficult to determine if that inaccurate information was provided purposely or truly by accident.
                    <br><br>
                    According to this theory, it would be nearly impossible to determine which theories are fact and which are fiction. It is more likely that the real ones are not as crazy as the more popular ones. This way there would be fewer eyes looking at the real ones since people tend to focusing on the crazier ones. If somehow this theory were to be proven true then the world would go crazy. The governments supplying these theories would likely be overrun by a society that is now angry because of all the secrets they kept that are now being revealed.
