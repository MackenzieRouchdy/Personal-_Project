                    For a long time now, Area 51 has been a popular topic among conspiracy theorists. Officially, it is a top secret military base where it is prohibited to enter or even fly over, but is still visible by google maps. Area 51 was built during the cold war for the creation of powerful fighter jets. An interesting point to take note of would be that even though the base opened in 1955 it was only publicly acknowledged by the CIA in 2013 and was even mentioned by President Obama.
                    <br><br>
                    Not much is known about what happens inside the secret base but is popular among people visiting the area. This place became so popular that it even became subject to a Facebook meme dubbed "They can't stop all of us" where a user on Facebook started a trend where on September 20th of 2019 thousands of people would raid the base in order to discover possible secrets that they have hidden there.

                        Through all sorts of movies and TV shows, perhaps the most popular conspiracy theory in the world has to do with aliens being experimented on in Area 51. 
                        It is thought that an alien UFO was captured and the pilot was experimented on to understand more about them and their biology. Numerous sightings of UFO's
                        around the area have been reported, but, these reports can easily be inaccurate. This claim also explains how the doctors that do the experimenting get 
                        there. Apparently in a nearby town, there is a bus that takes the employees of Area 51 to the top secret base. People have tried to follow the bus to the 
                        sight but couldn't since it crossed the no cross line where no one is allowed. It is also believed that the majority of the base is underground and there 
                        are large tunnels so that people inside the base can use vehicles to get places quickly. This would be where the majority of the experimenting would probably
                        be happening.

                    A less popular but still possible theory is that in Area 51 they are developing extremely advanced technology for offensives against other humans or defensive 
                    stances against aliens. This technology could be anything from an advanced fingerprint scanner to a weapon with drastic capabilities. If this claim were to be 
                    true then it would reach standards of secretive organizations in movies. It is possible that the government keeps this knowledge private as it could potentially 
                    be dangerous in the wrong hands which means it is probably something that is not too far off from movies.

                    It is not exactly common knowledge about what happens in this secret base, so anything is up to speculation. It is likely that both these theories were subject to heavy influence from mainstream media. Many movies contribute to both these theories and dive deep into fictional mysteries of Area 51.
                    <br><br>
                    These theories are further fueled by an alleged former Area 51 employee who has said to have been hired by the government to reverse engineer alien technology. While he has no evidence to support his claim he says that alien technology had something to do with antimatter and that he has read classified documents that prove alien involvement in human affairs for the last 10,000 years. We must also take into account that Lazar was also convicted of pandering and trading of illegal goods. With this information there is still no evidence to prove that these theories have any truth to them.
