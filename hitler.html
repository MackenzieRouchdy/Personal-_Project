                    On the 30th of April, 1945, surrounded by Soviet troops, Hitler used a Walther PPK 7.65 pistol to shoot himself in his right temple. Shortly after this, his wife, whom he had married a couple days prior in a bunker, killed herself as well using cyanide poisoning. Hitler's death was announced on the 1st of May 1945 when both his and his wife's body were sprayed with petrol and burned. According to sources, the Soviet Union released conspiracy theories explaining how Hitler was not dead and instead was being safeguarded by former Western allies.

                    There have been no reported eye witnesses to the actual shooting of Hitler but witnesses are said to have heard the bullet and smelled the cyanide shortly after the alleged deaths.

                        This theory originates from the popular history channel show called Hunting Hitler. In this show, investigators discovered and read classified documents that elaborate on Hitler's death and how it happened. In the show they also interview alleged witnesses that were involved in Hitler's escape from Germany to Argentina, where he and other Nazis were supposedly plotting a Fourth Reich. This claim explores the possibility of another reign of power for Hitler and how he continued to try and fulfill his agenda. An intriguing point about this theory involves Albert Panka who apparently was arrested over three hundred times. This is not because he had commited any crimes or reckless activity but because he was almost identical to the former leader of Germany. To add, this sighting was in South America in 1969.

                        Days before the death of Hitler, he married Evan Braun, a German photographer. The relationship was very private and no one knew about it until after both their alleged deaths. The two met when Braun was a 17 year old girl; she was the assistant to Heinrich Hoffmann who was Hitler's personal photographer at the time. In 1936, Braun moved into Hitler's household where she became part of Hitler's inner social circle. This theory states that Braun had secretly killed her husband and then took her own life to cover it up.

                        Both these theories just don't have enough evidence to be considered fact. The only reason these theories started was because of the people saying that they have seen and perhaps even aided Hitler in escaping to South America. Even though TV shows and movies claim that there have been documents and people with dangerous information, it is more than likely a money grab or just to make the content more interesting. These claims are hard to prove because of the lack of evidence and should be considered fake until proven real.
