                The Personal Project is a special activity spanning over a couple of months. Students may choose what they want to work on. The goal of this project is to build and
                 develop the interests of students with the only limitation being creativity. This project has the ability to change the student's interests and therefore possibly even 
                 changing where they want to go in the future. There are three main parts of the project:

            <img style="width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="2images/light bulb 2.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <div id="product">
            <div id="product_title">
                1.Product
            </div>
            <div id="product_text">
                This is the actual thing that the students will create, this is the result and the student's goal. For example, if the project was about a learning to play a guitar 
                then the product could possibly a video of the student playing the guitar. 
            </div>

        <div id="journal">
            <div id="journal_title">

            </div>
            <div id="journal_text">
                This is how students will keep track of their progress. Every time the student works on their project then they will write down, either on an online notebook or an
                 actual journal. It should encompass all of their sources, research, ideas etc..

            <div id="report_text">
                This is the examination of the journey the student took to get their product. It notes the impact it had on them and proof that they did it. This report is the bulk 
                of the mark.

                *All students will have a supervisor
