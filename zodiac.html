                    The Zodiac killer is one of the most famous unsolved murder cases that has eluded detectives and cipher crackers alike. There have been five confirmed deaths implicating the Zodiac Killer but the killer claimed to have killed thirty-seven. The Zodiac Killer sent several letters to different news outlets demanding they be published. The letters contained ciphers and cryptograms (encrypted text) where he would explain how he was collecting victims for the afterlife to use them as slaves. This case has never been solved. The authorities only ever mentioned one suspect whose DNA did not match the DNA of the killer, therefore it was a dead end.

                        The Zodiac's victims had no known connection and were not at all related. This leads theorists to think that the entire thing was a fake, pulled off by news outlets in order to sell more papers. This was close to an era where technology was becoming more and more advanced. Perhaps the newspaper outlets feared that their newspapers would stop being sold.

                        Savant Syndrome is a condition that only about one in ten autistic people have. This syndrome allows for extraordinary skills to come at ease such as photographic memory. If the Zodiac Killer had this syndrome it would explain his crazy letters about the afterlife and it would also shed light as to how he was able to evade capture and write the ciphers and cryptographs.

                        The first theory is plausible as it involves motive. This would be the money that could be made. At the time everyone knew that technology would be taking over whether they liked it or not. Although newspapers would still be mainstream for a while, the newspaper outlets were probably scared that their papers won't sell enough so they wanted to cement themselves in the news industry by having the most interesting storylines. They saw five unrelated murders come up and decided to link them all together with the letters supposedly getting mailed to them in order to create an unsolvable mystery. Overall, with this information it is definitely a possibility that this theory can be true but there is a lack of evidence.
